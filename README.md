# Morse Tutor

This project first appeared in RadCom - October 2015. To program the PIXACE used in the project 
with this code you will need to download one of the PICAXE editors found at 
http://www.picaxe.com - see the "Free Software" button top right. 
You will also need a programming cable that can be purchaced from http://www.techsupplies.co.uk.

If you don't want to go the trouble of buying the programming cable then I can supply 
pre-programmed PICAXE chips at a cost of £4.00 each - including P & P. 
Either send a cheque to the address below or make a PayPal payment 
to martin@the-wallers.net.

# Erratum

The transistor labelled TIP20 should be labelled TIP120.

## Notes

If you decide that you will not be wanting to re-program the PICAXE in situ then you can do away 
with the programming socket and the two resistors 10K and 22K. What will need to do is to ground 
pin 3 of the PICAXE. This is the Serial-In and if left floating strange things can happen!

You can turn the circuit into a simple Morse oscillator if you wish. This has been done by 
incorporating a switched 3.5mm mono jack socket. The switch is used to cut off the power 
from the PICAXE (Pin 14) and to short across the TIP-120.

If you wish to add an earphone socket then this is best done using a switched 3.5mm mono 
jack socket and configuring it across the speaker.
